# Density

Density controls spacing across the system through the `data-density` attribute.
The docs toolbar lets you switch between compact, default, and comfortable modes.

## How it works

Spacing tokens multiply against `--density-multiplier`, so switching density does
not trigger React re-renders.

```css
[data-density="compact"] {
  --density-multiplier: 0.85;
}
```
